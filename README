This is a Javascript library for tag hinting which you might have seen on various forums and blog site. I have created a easy to use library.

All you have to do is include the tag-hinting.js in your file and write the following syntax:
	<script type="text/html">arr = ['your','tag','values']</script>

Also it requires a html div to display the results.
	<div id="hintwords" style="display:none"></div>

You can add style to the above div.
